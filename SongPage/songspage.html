                If The World Was Ending” constitutes the third single of 2019
                for the Canadian musician JP Saxe, following “Same Room” and
                “Women Who Look Like You”. Throughout the song, Jonathan,
                together with Julia Michaels, reminisces over a past and flawed
                relationship, hopefully it can start again with the best
                intentions and a good amount of patience.
