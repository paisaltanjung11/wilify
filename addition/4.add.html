            "Tired of Wanting You" by Boy with Uke is a soulful ballad that
            delves into the complex emotions of unrequited love.<br />
            With gentle strumming and heartfelt vocals, the song captures the
            bittersweet essence of longing for someone who <br />
            remains out of reach. Each verse is a poignant reflection of the
            internal struggle, as the protagonist grapples with the <br />pain
            of desire and the realization that they must find the strength to
            let go.<br />

          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            I'm not sad, I'm not tired<br />
            But I feel I'm bad<br />
            I feel different from others<br />
            I wish I had what they have<br />
            But I'm just dreaming of randomness scheming<br />
            I got empty feelings<br />
            I wrestle my demons at night<br />
            I'm not sad, I'm just tired of wanting you<br />
            I want to say I think you're cute<br />
            But I can't say it now<br />
            Because that's not my character<br />
            Maybe in another universe<br />
            I just think that it's funny<br />
            That I cannot bring<br />
            Myself from my conscience to rid<br />
            Of my butterfly things<br />
            I don't feel right when I'm not with you<br />
            I'll keep you insight, but I won't pursue<br />
            I'm not sad, I'm just tired of wanting you<br />
            I want to say I think you're cute<br />
            But I can't say it now because<br />
            If I do I'll never sleep<br />
            If you say no to me, but you'll probably<br />
            I'm not sad, I'm just tired of wanting you<br />
            I want to say I think you're cute<br />
            But I can't say it now<br />
            Because that's not my character<br />
            Maybe in another universe<br />
