          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            Telling myself I won't go there<br />
            Oh, but I know that I won't care<br />
            Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt<br />
            This lust is a burden that we both share<br />
            Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer<br />
            Souls tied, intertwined by our pride and guilt<br />
            There's darkness in the distance<br />
            From the way that I've been livin'<br />
            But I know I can't resist it<br />
            Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br />
            You and I drink the poison from the same vine<br />
            Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br />
            Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight<br />
            From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br />
            From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br />
            Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br />
            Tellin' myself it's the last time<br />
            Can you spare any mercy that you might find<br />
            If I'm down on my knees again?<br />
            Deep down, way down, Lord, I try<br />
            Try to follow your light, but it's night time<br />
            Please, don't leave me in the end<br />
            There's darkness in the distance<br />
            I'm beggin' for forgiveness (ooh)<br />
            But I know I might resist it, oh<br />
            Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br />
            You and I drink the poison from the same vine<br />
            Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br />
            Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight<br />
            From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br />
            From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br />
            Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br />
            Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br />
            You and I drink the poison from the same vine<br />
            Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br />
            Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight<br />
            From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br />
            From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br />
            Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br />
