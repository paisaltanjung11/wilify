            "Cars Outside" by James is an evocative exploration of longing and
            introspection set against a backdrop of nighttime solitude.<br />
            With its haunting melodies and soulful vocals, the song paints a
            vivid picture of a solitary figure gazing out at the world from the
            <br />
            confines of their room, watching the cars pass by outside. The
            lyrics delve into themes of isolation, yearning, and the desire for
            connection, <br />as the protagonist grapples with feelings of
            loneliness and the search for meaning in the midst of urban life.<br />

          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            I'm packin' my bags that I didn't unpack the last time<br />
            I'm sayin', "See you again, " so many times, it's becoming my
            tagline<br />
            But you know the truth, I'd rather hold you<br />
            Than try to catch this flight<br />
            So many things I'd rather say<br />
            But for now, it's goodbye<br />
            You say I'm always leavin'<br />
            You, when you're sleepin' alone<br />
            But the, the car's outside<br />
            But I don't wanna go tonight<br />
            I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee<br />
            Unless you pack your bags<br />
            You're comin' with me<br />
            I'm tired of lovin' from afar<br />
            And never being where you are<br />
            Close the windows, lock the doors<br />
            Don't wanna leave you anymore<br />
            Oh-oh, ah<br />
            I'm starin' at the same four walls in a different hotel<br />
            It's an unfamiliar feelin' but I know it so well<br />
            Oh, but you know the truth, I'd rather hold you<br />
            Than this mobile in my hand<br />
            But I guess it'll do, 'cause for you<br />
            I would run up my phone bill<br />
            You say I'm always leavin'<br />
            You, when you need me the most<br />
            But the, the car's outside<br />
            But I don't wanna go tonight<br />
            I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee<br />
            Unless you pack your bags<br />
            You're comin' with me<br />
            I'm tired of lovin' from afar<br />
            And never being where you are<br />
            Close the windows, lock the doors<br />
            Don't wanna leave you anymore<br />
            Ooh-ooh, ah<br />
            Ooh-ooh, ah<br />
            Ooh-ooh, ah<br />
            Don't wanna leave you anymore<br />
            Oh, darling, all of the city lights<br />
            Never shine as bright as your eyes<br />
            I would trade them all for a minute more<br />
            But the car's outside<br />
            And he's called me twice<br />
            But he's gonna have to wait tonight<br />
            I'm not gettin' in the Addison Lee<br />
            Unless you pack your bags<br />
            You're comin' with me<br />
            I'm tired of lovin' from afar<br />
            And never being where you are<br />
            Close the windows, lock the doors<br />
            Don't wanna leave you anymore<br />
            Ooh-ooh, ah<br />
            Ooh-ooh, ah<br />
            Ooh-ooh, ah<br />
            No, I don't wanna leave you anymore<br />
            I don't wanna leave you<br />
            (Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you<br />
            (Ooh-ooh, ah) I don't wanna leave you<br />
            Don't wanna leave you anymore<br />
