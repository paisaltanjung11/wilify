          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            There I was again tonight<br />
            Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br />
            Same old tired, lonely place<br />
            Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy<br />
            Vanished when I saw your face<br />
            All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you<br />
            Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"<br />
            'Cross the room your silhouette<br />
            Starts to make its way to me<br />
            The playful conversation starts<br />
            Counter all your quick remarks<br />
            Like passing notes in secrecy<br />
            And it was enchanting to meet you<br />
            All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you<br />
            This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br />
            I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br />
            I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
            I was enchanted to meet you<br />
            The lingering question kept me up<br />
            2 AM, who do you love?<br />
            I wonder 'til I'm wide awake<br />
            And now I'm pacing back and forth<br />
            Wishing you were at my door<br />
            I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"<br />
            It was enchanting to meet you<br />
            All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you<br />
            This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br />
            I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br />
            I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
            That this night is flawless, don't you let it go<br />
            I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br />
            I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
            I was enchanted to meet you<br />
            This is me praying that<br />
            This was the very first page<br />
            Not where the story line ends<br />
            My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again<br />
            These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon<br />
            I was enchanted to meet you<br />
            Please don't be in love with someone else<br />
            Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br />
            Please don't be in love with someone else<br />
            Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br />
            This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br />
            I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br />
            I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
            This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br />
            I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br />
            I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
            I was enchanted to meet you<br />
            Please don't be in love with someone else<br />
            Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br />
