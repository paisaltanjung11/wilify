            “If The World Was Ending” constitutes the third single of 2019 for
            the Canadian musician JP <br />Saxe, following “Same Room” and
            “Women Who Look Like You”. <br />Throughout the song, Jonathan,
            together with Julia Michaels, reminisces over a past and <br />
            flawed relationship, hopefully it can start again with the best
            intentions and a good <br />
            amount of patience.

          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            I was distracted<br />
            And in traffic<br />
            I didn't feel it<br />
            When the earthquake happened<br />
            But it really got me thinkin'<br />
            Were you out drinkin'?<br />
            Were you in the living room<br />
            Chillin' watchin' television?<br />
            It's been a year now<br />
            Think I've figured out how<br />
            How to let you go and let communication die out<br />
            I know, you know, we know<br />
            You weren't down for forever and it's fine<br />
            I know, you know, we know<br />
            We weren't meant for each other and it's fine<br />
            But if the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            You'd come over and you'd stay the night<br />
            Would you love me for the hell of it?<br />
            All our fears would be irrelevant<br />
            If the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight<br />
            And there wouldn't be a reason why<br />
            We would even have to say goodbye<br />
            If the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            Right?<br />
            If the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            Right?<br />
            I tried to imagine<br />
            Your reaction<br />
            It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened<br />
            But it really got me thinkin'<br />
            That night we went drinkin'<br />
            Stumbled in the house<br />
            And didn't make it past the kitchen<br />
            Ah, it's been a year now<br />
            Think I've figured out how<br />
            How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out<br />
            I know, you know, we know<br />
            You weren't down for forever and it's fine<br />
            I know, you know, we know<br />
            We weren't meant for each other and it's fine<br />
            But if the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            You'd come over and you'd stay the night<br />
            Would you love me for the hell of it?<br />
            All our fears would be irrelevant<br />
            If the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight<br />
            No, there wouldn't be a reason why<br />
            We would even have to say goodbye<br />
            If the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?<br />
            I know, you know, we know<br />
            You weren't down for forever and it's fine<br />
            I know, you know, we know<br />
            We weren't meant for each other and it's fine<br />
            But if the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            You'd come over and you'd stay the night<br />
            Would you love me for the hell of it?<br />
            All our fears would be irrelevant<br />
            If the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            The sky'd be falling while I hold you tight<br />
            No, there wouldn't be a reason why<br />
            We would even have to say goodbye<br />
            If the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
            You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?<br />
            If the world was ending<br />
            You'd come over, right?<br />
