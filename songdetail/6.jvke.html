          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            Love is a walk in the park<br />
            That's how I feel at the start<br />
            Pretty until it gets dark<br />
            Love is a walk in the park<br />
            'Til you get bit by a dog<br />
            I never knew you could bark<br />
            When the seasons change<br />
            You won't feel the same at all<br />
            Because summer will turn into fall<br />
            Then you'll leave me, you're gone<br />
            You don't need me at all<br />
            Like the trees in the autumn breeze<br />
            It's ironic the way that you leave<br />
            Love is like riding a bike<br />
            Scary but then it's alright<br />
            I got the hang of it, right?<br />
            'Til you start moving too fast<br />
            Look up and you're 'bout to crash<br />
            Why doesn't love ever last?<br />
            So call me a pessimist<br />
            I think I'm a realist living a lie<br />
            Every night that I hold you inside of these arms<br />
            Knowing too well you'll move on<br />
            As soon as the warm weather's gone<br />
            When the seasons change<br />
            You won't feel the same at all<br />
            Because summer will turn into fall<br />
            Then you'll leave me, you're gone<br />
            You don't need me at all<br />
            Like the trees in the autumn breeze<br />
            It's ironic the way that you leave<br />
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ah<br />
            Like the trees in the autumn breeze<br />
            It's ironic the way that you leave<br />
