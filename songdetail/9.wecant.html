            "We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)" by Ariana Grande is a
            soulful ballad that explores the complexities of unrequited love and
            the struggle to move on from a past relationship.<br />
            Grande's emotive vocals and heartfelt lyrics convey the pain of
            longing for someone who can't reciprocate those feelings.<br />
            The song's poignant melody and haunting instrumentation create a
            sense of melancholy and yearning, drawing listeners into the
            emotional journey of heartbreak and acceptance.<br />

          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            I didn't think you'd understand me<br />
            How could you ever even try?<br />
            I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide<br />
            But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire<br />
            Just wanna let this story die<br />
            And I'll be alright<br />
            We can't be friends<br />
            But I'd like to just pretend<br />
            You cling to your papers and pens<br />
            Wait until you like me again<br />
            Wait for your love<br />
            Love, I'll wait for your love<br />
            Me and my truth, we sit in silence<br />
            Baby girl, it's just me and you<br />
            'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite<br />
            My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die<br />
            You got me misunderstood, but at least I look this good<br />
            We can't be friends<br />
            But I'd like to just pretend<br />
            You cling to your papers and pens<br />
            Wait until you like me again<br />
            Wait for your love<br />
            Love, I'll wait for your love<br />
            I'll wait for your love<br />
            Love, I'll wait for your love<br />
            Know that you made me<br />
            I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging<br />
            Not what you made me<br />
            It's something like a daydream<br />
            But I feel so seen in the night<br />
            So for now, it's only me<br />
            And maybe that's all I need<br />
            We can't be friends<br />
            But I'd like to just pretend<br />
            You cling to your papers and pens<br />
            Wait until you like me again<br />
            Wait for your love<br />
            Love, I'll wait for your love<br />
            I'll wait for your love<br />
            Love, I'll wait for your love<br />
            I'll wait for your love<br />
            I'll wait for your love<br />
            I'll wait for your love<br />
            I'll wait for your love<br />
