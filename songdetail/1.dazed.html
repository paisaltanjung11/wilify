            "Dazed & Confused" marks the third single of 2015 for the Canadian
            musician Ruel, following "Don’t Tell Me" and "Younger."
            <br />
            In this track, Ruel navigates the tumultuous feelings of infatuation
            and uncertainty that often accompany young love.
            <br />
            With heartfelt lyrics and a soulful voice, he captures the highs and
            lows of emotional confusion, hoping to find clarity and connection
            amidst the chaos.

          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            You came in swinging like Apollo<br />
            I'll be feeling it tomorrow<br />
            No, I ain't seeing straight, hyperventilate<br />
            Knees begin to wobble<br />
            You cut my brakes and hit the throttle<br />
            I couldn't stop it if I wanted<br />
            Dizzy silhouette, makes me break a sweat<br />
            I'm in trouble<br />
            Oh, I've been dazed and confused<br />
            From the day I met you<br />
            Yeah, I lost my head<br />
            And I'd do it again<br />
            Either I've seen the light<br />
            Or I'm losing my mind<br />
            There's something 'bout you<br />
            That's got me dazed and confused<br />
            Dazed<br />
            Dazed and confused<br />
            Dazed<br />
            I bet you know just what you're doing<br />
            You're not the type that's used to losing<br />
            First, you build me up, then with just a touch<br />
            Leave me here in ruins<br />
            Something 'bout your eyes<br />
            I can't even walk in a straight line<br />
            Under the influence<br />
            Oh, I've been dazed and confused<br />
            From the day I met you<br />
            Yeah, I lost my head<br />
            And I'd do it again<br />
            Either I've seen the light<br />
            Or I'm losing my mind<br />
            There's something 'bout you<br />
            That's got me dazed and confused<br />
            Dazed<br />
            Dazed and confused<br />
            Dazed<br />
            I don't know if this is real life, real life<br />
            What happens if I open my eyes, my eyes?<br />
            Will I ever get my head right, head right?<br />
            I don't know if this is real life, real life<br />
            Oh, I've been dazed and confused<br />
            From the day I met you<br />
            Yeah, I lost my head<br />
            And I'd do it again<br />
            Either I've seen the light<br />
            Or I'm losing my mind<br />
            There's something 'bout you<br />
            That's got me<br />
            That's got me dazed and confused<br />
            From the day I met you<br />
            Yeah, I lost my head<br />
            And I'd do it again<br />
            Either I've seen the light<br />
            Or I'm losing my mind<br />
            There's something 'bout you<br />
            That's got me<br />
            Dazed and confused<br />
