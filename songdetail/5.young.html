            "Young and Beautiful" by Lana Del Rey is a hauntingly beautiful
            ballad that delves into themes of youth, love, and mortality.<br />
            With Del Rey's signature ethereal vocals and lush instrumentation,
            the song captures a sense of longing and vulnerability.<br />
            The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a romance that feels timeless
            yet fragile, as the singer grapples with the fear of losing her
            beauty and the fleeting nature of youth.<br />
            As the melody sweeps listeners away, "Young and Beautiful" becomes a
            poignant reflection on the passage of time and the desire for
            everlasting love.<br />
            It's a mesmerizing ode to the complexities of relationships and the
            bittersweet beauty of youth.<br />

          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            I've seen the world, done it all, had my cake now<br />
            Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now<br />
            Hot summer nights, mid-July<br />
            When you and I were forever wild<br />
            The crazy days, city lights<br />
            The way you'd play with me like a child<br />
            Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?<br />
            Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?<br />
            I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will<br />
            Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?<br />
            I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now<br />
            Channeling angels in the new age now<br />
            Hot summer days, rock and roll<br />
            The way you'd play for me at your show<br />
            And all the ways I got to know<br />
            Your pretty face and electric soul<br />
            Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?<br />
            Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?<br />
            I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will<br />
            Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?<br />
            Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven<br />
            Please let me bring my man<br />
            When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in<br />
            Father, tell me if you can<br />
            All that grace, all that body<br />
            All that face makes me wanna party<br />
            He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds<br />
            Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?<br />
            Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?<br />
            I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will<br />
            Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?<br />
            Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?<br />
            Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?<br />
