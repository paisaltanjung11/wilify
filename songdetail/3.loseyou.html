            "Lose You to Love Me" is a poignant ballad that showcases Selena
            Gomez's raw vulnerability and emotional depth.<br />
            Through hauntingly beautiful vocals and evocative lyrics, Gomez
            takes listeners on a journey of self-discovery and healing.<br />
            The song reflects on the pain of letting go of a toxic relationship,
            but also celebrates the empowerment that comes from choosing
            self-love and moving forward.<br />

          <h3>Lyrics</h3>
          <p>
            You promised the world and I fell for it<br />
            I put you first and you adored it<br />
            Set fires to my forest<br />
            And you let it burn<br />
            Sang off-key in my chorus<br />
            'Cause it wasn't yours<br />
            I saw the signs and I ignored it<br />
            Rose-colored glasses all distorted<br />
            Set fire to my purpose<br />
            And I let it burn<br />
            You got off on the hurtin'<br />
            When it wasn't yours, yeah<br />
            We'd always go into it blindly<br />
            I needed to lose you to find me<br />
            This dancing was killing me softly<br />
            I needed to hate you to love me, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, yeah<br />
            I needed to lose you to love me, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, yeah<br />
            I needed to lose you to love me<br />
            I gave my all and they all know it<br />
            Then you tore me down and now it's showing<br />
            In two months, you replaced us<br />
            Like it was easy<br />
            Made me think I deserved it<br />
            In the thick of healing, yeah<br />
            We'd always go into it blindly<br />
            I needed to lose you to find me<br />
            This dancing was killing me softly<br />
            I needed to hate you to love me, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, yeah<br />
            I needed to lose you to love me, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, yeah<br />
            I needed to lose you to love me<br />
            You promised the world and I fell for it<br />
            I put you first and you adored it<br />
            Set fires to my forest<br />
            And you let it burn<br />
            Sang off-key in my chorus<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, yeah<br />
            I needed to hate you to love me, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, yeah<br />
            I needed to lose you to love me<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, yeah<br />
            And now the chapter is closed and done<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, love, yeah<br />
            To love, yeah<br />
            And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us<br />
